This project aims to develop a text-to-SQL web application that leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate SQL queries based on user-provided questions and context. The application utilizes the Mixtral text-to-SQL model, powered by Groq, to accurately interpret user queries and produce corresponding SQL queries for database retrieval.

Key Features:

User Interaction: Users can upload CSV files containing database tables and ask questions about the data using natural language queries.
Text-to-SQL Conversion: The application utilizes the Mixtral text-to-SQL model to convert user questions into SQL queries, allowing seamless interaction with the database.
Query Execution: The generated SQL queries are executed against the database tables, and the results are displayed to the user in an intuitive format.
Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure smooth operation, with informative error messages provided to users in case of query execution failures or other issues.

Implementation Details:
The backend of the application is built using Python, with libraries such as pandas, Streamlit, and Groq employed for data processing, web interface development, and text-to-SQL conversion, respectively.
The frontend interface is developed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly experience for uploading CSV files, entering questions, and viewing query results.
The application incorporates a template-based approach for generating prompts to the Mixtral model, ensuring consistency and clarity in user interactions.

Sample Questions Addressed:
Basic Queries: Users can ask simple questions about the data, such as retrieving specific columns or filtering records based on certain criteria.
Complex Queries: The application supports more complex queries involving joins, subqueries, aggregations, and advanced functions for in-depth data analysis.
Optimization Queries: Users can inquire about optimization techniques to improve query performance, such as indexing strategies or query rewriting.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip or conda.
Run the Streamlit application locally using the command streamlit run app.py.
Upload CSV files containing database tables and start querying the data using natural language questions.

Future Enhancements:
Integration with additional text-to-SQL models for comparison and improved query accuracy.
Enhanced visualization capabilities for displaying query results, including charts and graphs.
Implementation of user authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure data access.
